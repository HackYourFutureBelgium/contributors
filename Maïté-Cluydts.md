Thanks again a million for all you have achieved for HackYourFuture. Without you, this project wouldn't be alive and going forward today! You are welcome anytime you want and I'm sure you will be one of the best volunteer there can be. Take care and see you around on sundays!

Liefste Ma√Øt√©,

It is difficult to put into words how much you will be missed at the office... your energy, enthusiasm, laugh, down to earth attitude, etc are just a few examples! It was an absolute pleasure to work with you!!
Wishing you all the best in your future career and life in general :sourire:! Let's keep in touch!
See you at Open Belgium :clin_d'≈ìil:.

Hug,

Hack Your Future Belgium? More like Hack Your Future _Ma√Øt√©_.  You pulled us all together from a small starting class to what we are today.  Hack Your Future, it's alumni, students, coaches and team wouldn't still be meeting on Sundays with a bright future if you hadn't put in such dedicated work over the last year.

Here's to many more Sundays and a Hack The Talk or two! Maybe even a talk on how to run a Hack Your Future? You could give a pretty good one by now.

See ya,

- Evan
