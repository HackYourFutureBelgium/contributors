# Thank You All!

[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-2-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

Hack Your Future would not exist without all of the volunteer contributions, big and little.  To make sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve we invite you to add anyone to this repository who you think deserves a little round of applause.

Contributions can be anything, even work that doesn't appear on GitHub.
* Is there a coach that went above and beyond to support you over the week?
* Is there a student that makes the extra effort to support their peers?  
* And how about everyone that works behind the scenes to make sure we have class rooms, speakers, and snacks between class?   

All of these are contributions that deserve to be recognized!

The only catch is that whoever you'd like to recognize needs to have a GitHub account. But don't let that stop you!  Just let them know they should create an account so you can recognize them publically.

### Recognizing Contributors


[Every contribution should be recognized](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors).  


To add a new contributor to this repository [create a new issue with the `New Contributors` template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/contributors/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new-contributor.md&title=FirstName+LastName), name it after the person you'd like to recognize (`FirstName LastName`), then write a structured message so the [the All-Contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) will add them to the README:

> @all-contributors please add @username for [a category of contribution](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)



Before creating a new issue, please [search through the existing issues](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/contributors/issues) to make sure this person hasn't already been recognized.  
* If they already have an issue named after them, you can recognize them even more by adding a new comment with a structured message and a new [All-Contributor's category](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key). The [the All-Contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) will take care of the rest.    
* If you like the kind words someone else has already written, drop an emoji on the comment to show your appreciation.  
* If you think a simple emoji isn't enough, please write your kind words in a new comment. Everyone likes a hand-written note


Don't be shy, no contribution is too small to recognize!
