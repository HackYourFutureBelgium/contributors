[Every contribution should be recognized](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors).  


To add a new contributor to this repository create a new issue (which you're doing right now ;), name it after the person you'd like to recognize (`FirstName LastName`), then write a structured message so the [the All-Contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) will add them to the README:

> @all-contributors please add @username for [a category of contribution](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)



Before creating a new issue, please [search through the existing issues](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/contributors/issues) to make sure this person hasn't already been recognized.  
* If they already have an issue named after them, you can recognize them for new contributions by adding a new [All-Contributor's category](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) to their with a structured message in a new comment. The [the All-Contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) will take care of the rest.    
* If you like the kind words someone else has already written, drop an emoji on the comment to show your appreciation.  
* If you think a simple emoji isn't enough, please write your kind words in a new comment. Everyone likes a hand-written note
